**UOC Gamers** is a Unity project that includes a collection of **three 2D mini-games** and one **VR prototype**.  
Each game is inspired by popular festivities and themes, combining arcade-style mechanics with short-session gameplay.

This repository is presented as an **academic project** developed for the **DAM program** at the **Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)** by the **UOC Gamers** team.

## Games Included

### Castanyera (2D)
Objects fall from the top of the screen (**chestnuts and stones**).  
Players control a character (the Castanyera woman) and must **catch chestnuts** while avoiding obstacles.

### Halloween Arkanoid (2D)
A Halloween-themed Arkanoid-style game.  
A **pumpkin** bounces around the level while the player controls a **broom** paddle to break **eye-shaped blocks**.

### Luz Divina (2D Puzzle)
A candle puzzle game with a **3x3 grid**.  
When you press a candle, it toggles its state and also toggles the adjacent candles, requiring logic to **switch all candles off**.

### Running of the Bulls (VR Prototype)
A VR prototype inspired by **San Fermín**.  
Players move through **three lanes** and must avoid incoming **bulls and obstacles** by tilting their head (gyroscope-based movement).  
Difficulty increases progressively over time.
